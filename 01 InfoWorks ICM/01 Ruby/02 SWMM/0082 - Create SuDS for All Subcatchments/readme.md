# Code Summary: Creating SUDS Control Data for Subcatchments in ICM UI

## Script Overview
- The script begins by accessing the current network object in the ICM UI application.

## Key Functionalities
1. **CSV Header Setup**:
   - Initializes a CSV header array with relevant fields like 'Subcatchment ID', 'SUDS structure ID', 'Control type', etc.

2. **Data Generation Process**:
   - Begins a transaction to ensure data integrity.
   - Iterates over each subcatchment object in the network.
   - For each subcatchment:
     - Iterates through its associated SUDS controls.
     - Sets the ID of each control based on the subcatchment ID, appending "_SUDS" for differentiation.
     - Prints the ID of each control to the console.
   - Writes the updated control data back to the subcatchment.
   - Commits the transaction after successfully updating all subcatchments.

3. **Output**:
   - Displays a message upon completion of creating SUDS control data for each subcatchment.

## Summary
This script is an effective utility for automating the creation and assignment of SUDS control data to subcatchments in an ICM UI network. It simplifies the process of associating SUDS controls with subcatchments, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of managing sustainable urban drainage systems. The script's approach of iterating over subcatchments and updating control data ensures that all relevant subcatchments are accurately equipped with necessary SUDS information.
