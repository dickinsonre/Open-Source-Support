# Get Model Objects From Run

This script demonstrates how to quickly locate (or create) a control WSRowObject from a network WSRowObject. It is intended to run from Exchange and will perform a debug print like this:

```txt
Network Row Object: ST27363601
Control Row Object: ST27363601
```

You can use the method `control_ro` in your own scripts.
