## Code Summary: Accessing and Managing Network Data in WSApplication

### Source
- The script is sourced from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/chaitanyalakeshri/ruby_scripts).
  https://github.com/chaitanyalakeshri/ruby_scripts
### Purpose
The script is designed to access and manipulate various types of row objects in a WSApplication network, such as nodes, links, and subcatchments.

### Process Flow

1. **Begin Block**
   - The script initiates with a `begin` block for handling exceptions.

2. **Accessing the Current Network**
   - `net = WSApplication.current_network`: Fetches the current network.
   - An error is raised if the current network is not found.

3. **Accessing Row Object Collections**
   - Fetches collections of different network elements (nodes, links, subcatchments, pumps) as row object collections (ROCs).
   - Checks for the existence of these collections and raises an error if any collection is not found.

4. **Accessing Individual Row Objects**
   - Retrieves arrays of network elements.
   - Additionally, accesses specific elements like a conduit using its ID.

5. **Manipulating Specific Row Objects**
   - Demonstrates how to retrieve and modify properties of individual row objects, like getting the length of a conduit.
   - Shows how to select a particular object and clear all selections in the network.

6. **Error Handling**
   - The script includes error handling to catch and display messages for any issues encountered during execution.

### Notes
- The script is useful for detailed analysis and management of network data in WSApplication.
- It allows for both broad and specific access to network components, enabling targeted data manipulation and analysis.
- The clear structure and comprehensive error handling make the script robust and user-friendly.
