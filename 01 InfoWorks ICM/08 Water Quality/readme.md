# Sample InfoWorks ICM Models for setup of water quality parameters.

Please ensure that you have read and understood the main concepts and principles provided in the Help files before embarking on these examples.
See the 'Water Quality Simulations (InfoWorks)' topic and sub-topic for information on how to simulate the build-up of sediment in the network and the movement of sediment and determinants through the drainage system: https://help.autodesk.com/view/IWICMS/{RELEASE_VERSION}/ENU/?guid=GUID-6A112A9C-1ECB-4B27-814E-700AD81FFA37
See the '2D Water Quality Simulations' topic and sub-topic for information on how suspended sediment and bed load transport can be modelled in the 2D domain for InfoWorks Networks: https://help.autodesk.com/view/IWICMS/{RELEASE_VERSION}/ENU/?guid=GUID-25E640FC-E2B2-4E5A-84BE-F9E71A7973B9
