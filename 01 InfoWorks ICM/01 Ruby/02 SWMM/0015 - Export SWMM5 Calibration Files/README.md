# Code Summary: Generating Node Flood Depth Data for SWMM5 Calibration in InfoWorks

## Library
- The script utilizes the `date` library for handling time-related operations.

## Script Overview
- The script begins by accessing the current network object from InfoWorks and retrieves the list of timesteps.

## Key Functionalities
1. **Timestep Validation**:
   - Checks if there are more than one timestep available. If not, it outputs a warning and exits.

2. **Time Interval Calculation**:
   - Calculates the time interval between timesteps in seconds, assuming they are evenly spaced.

3. **Data Generation for SWMM5 Calibration**:
   - Sets up the field name to extract results (here, 'FloodDepth').
   - Prints headers for the SWMM5 calibration file format.
   - Iterates through each selected object in the network:
     - Attempts to retrieve the corresponding row object using the node id.
     - Skips the iteration if the object is not relevant (not a link).
     - Extracts and processes flood depth results for each timestep.
     - Calculates the exact time for each result, converting it into days, hours, and minutes.
     - Formats and outputs the data in a manner suitable for SWMM5 calibration files.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Includes error handling to report any issues encountered during the data processing.

## Summary
This script is an efficient tool for preparing node flood depth data from an InfoWorks network for SWMM5 calibration. It ensures that the data is accurately timed and formatted according to SWMM5 requirements, making it a valuable asset for hydraulic modelers working on calibration tasks. The script's structured approach and clear output format facilitate easy integration of InfoWorks data into SWMM5 models.
