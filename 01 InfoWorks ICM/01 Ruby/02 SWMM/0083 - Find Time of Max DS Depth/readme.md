# Code Summary: Analyzing Downstream Depth in InfoWorks Network

## Library
- The script uses the `date` library to manage date and time data.

## Script Overview
- The script starts by obtaining the current network object from InfoWorks and retrieves the list of timesteps.

## Key Functionalities
1. **Time Interval Calculation**:
   - Calculates the time interval between timesteps in minutes, assuming they are evenly spaced.
   - Displays a warning message and exits early if there's only one or no timestep.

2. **Analysis of Downstream Depth**:
   - Focuses on the downstream depth (denoted as 'ds_depth').
   - Iterates through each selected object in the network.
   - For each object:
     - Retrieves the corresponding row object using the upstream node id.
     - Extracts and analyzes 'ds_depth' results across all timesteps.
     - Finds the maximum depth value and its corresponding time.
     - Converts the time of maximum depth into days, hours, minutes, and seconds format.
     - Prints the link ID, maximum downstream depth, and the formatted time of occurrence.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Includes error handling to manage and report any issues encountered during processing.

## Summary
This script is a specialized tool for analyzing temporal variations in downstream depths within selected network objects in InfoWorks. It provides valuable insights into the behavior of the network under different conditions by pinpointing the time and magnitude of maximum downstream depths. The script's structured approach and clear output format make it an effective tool for network analysis in hydraulic modeling applications.
