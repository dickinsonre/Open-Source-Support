# InfoWorks WS Pro - VBScripts

This folder contains various VBscripts for use with WS Pro. VBScripts are used to apply logic, conditions and/or conversions to object data as it's being imported or exported via the Open Data Import/Export Centre. WS Pro uses the `.bas` file extension for its VBScripts.

Please be aware that VBScript is **not** the same as Visual Basic, Visual Basic.NET, VBScript.NET, or Visual Basic For Applications. Information about the VBScript language [can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript).
