# InfoWorks ICM

Welcome to the InfoWorks ICM Scripts and Model repository! This repository contains open source Ruby, SQL, Python, and other scripts for building and using [InfoWorks ICM](https://help.autodesk.com/view/IWICMS/2026/ENU/) models. Example Themes and models are provided in the areas of Hydrology, Regulator Control, 2D Structures and Water Quality.

## Folder Structure

The repositories are organized into subfolders based on the simulation engines they support. InfoWorks ICM supports two simulation engines: the InfoWorks engine and the SWMM5 engine. Each engine has its own subfolder. When it comes to writing scripts, the main difference is each engine uses different names for objects and their attributes. For models there is often differences in functionality and terminology. It is the InfoWorks engine that has the most comprehensive set of capabilities.
