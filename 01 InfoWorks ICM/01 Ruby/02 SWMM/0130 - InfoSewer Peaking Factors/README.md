Summary of the Code
This Ruby script processes results from a network model, specifically focusing on links and their flow statistics. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

Skip Nil Row Objects:

The script skips any iteration where the row object (ro) is nil.
Retrieve Results:

It retrieves the results for a specified field (res_field_name) from the row object.
Ensure Results Match Timesteps:

It checks if the number of results matches the number of timesteps (ts.size).
Initialize Statistics Variables:

Initializes variables to calculate total flow, count, minimum value, and maximum value.
Iterate Through Results:

For each result:
Converts the result to a floating-point number.
Converts the flow from Million Gallons per Day (MGD) to Gallons per Minute (GPM).
Calculates the peak GPM using a specific formula.
Updates the total flow, minimum value, maximum value, and count.
Prints the flow value and peak GPM for each element.
Calculate Mean Value:

After iterating through all results, it calculates the mean flow value.
Print Statistics:

Prints the link ID, field name, mean value, maximum value, minimum value, and the number of steps (timesteps).
Handle Mismatched Timesteps:

If the number of results does not match the number of timesteps, it prints a mismatch error message.
Error Handling:

If any error occurs during processing, it catches the exception and prints an error message with the link ID and field name.
Database Fields Definition:

Defines an array database_fields containing field names related to ICM network nodes.
Clear Selection and Print Scenario:

Clears the current selection in the network.
Prints the current scenario name.
Example Output
The script prints detailed statistics for each link, including individual flow values and overall statistics. It also handles errors gracefully and provides informative messages.

Conclusion
This script is designed to process and analyze flow data from network links, providing detailed statistics and handling potential errors effectively. It ensures that the results are consistent with the expected timesteps and outputs useful information for further analysis.
