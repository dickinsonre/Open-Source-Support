# InfoWorks ICM Scripts

Welcome to the InfoWorks ICM Scripts repository! This repository contains open source Ruby, SQL, Python, and other scripts for building and using [InfoWorks ICM](https://help.autodesk.com/view/IWICMS/2024/ENU/) models.

## Folder Structure

The scripts in this repository are organized into subfolders based on the simulation engines they support. InfoWorks ICM supports two simulation engines: the InfoWorks engine and the SWMM5 engine. Each engine has its own subfolder. When it comes to writing scripts, the main difference is each engine uses different names for objects and their attributes.
