# Expand (Short) Links

These scripts demonstrate how to use the Expand Short Links method, which is equivalent to the Expand Short Links tool available in the user interface.

This method is available in the User Interface and Exchange. These scripts are written to run from the user interface.

- [expand.rb](./expand.rb) expands short links, equivalent to the user interface
- [expand_and_simplify.rb](./expand_and_simplify.rb) expands short links and simplifies the resulting geometry, which improves the display of symbols
