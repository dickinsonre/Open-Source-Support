## Summary of Ruby Script for Analyzing Network Timesteps

### Overview
This script, written in Ruby, interfaces with the InfoWorks software to analyze time-stepped data in a network model. It focuses on calculating statistical measures for flow data (upstream and downstream) across selected network objects, assuming evenly spaced timesteps.

### Key Steps

1. **Import Libraries**
   - Utilizes the `date` library for handling date and time operations.

2. **Retrieve Network Object**
   - Fetches the current network object from InfoWorks using `WSApplication.current_network`.

3. **List Timesteps**
   - Acquires a list of timesteps available in the network model.

4. **Check for Adequate Timesteps**
   - Ensures there are more than one timestep available to proceed with the analysis.

5. **Calculate Time Interval**
   - Determines the time interval in seconds between the first two timesteps.

6. **Define Result Fields**
   - Sets the fields of interest for analysis: `us_flow` (upstream flow) and `ds_flow` (downstream flow).

7. **Iterate Over Selected Objects**
   - Processes each selected object in the network:
     - Retrieves related data using the object's ID.
     - Checks if the object is a valid link.
     - For each result field, gathers and verifies the timestep results.

8. **Statistics Computation**
   - For each valid link and result field, calculates:
     - Total integrated flow over time.
     - Mean, maximum, and minimum flow values.
     - Counts the number of timesteps analyzed.

9. **Error Handling**
   - Catches and logs any errors that occur during the processing of each object.

### Output
- The script outputs the time interval in both seconds and minutes, along with detailed statistics for each link and specified result field, including sum, mean, max, min values, and the count of timesteps.
