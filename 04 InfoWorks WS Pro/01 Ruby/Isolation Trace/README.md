# Isolation Trace

This script demonstrates the `WSOpenNetwork.isolation_trace` method which is similar to the User Interface isolation trace tool. You provide a selection of objects to isolate, and the method determines the appropriate valves to shut, and returns all of the objects isolated as a direct result of closing those valves.

Note that this method uses the class `WSNetSelectionList`, which is only available in WS Pro Exchange. As of September 2024, this class is not officially documented.
